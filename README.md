## Requirements:
- [Ironmon-Tracker v7.3.0](https://github.com/besteon/Ironmon-Tracker) or higher

## Install:
1) Download the [latest release](https://github.com/UTDZac/ImAttached-IronmonExtension/releases/latest) of this extension from the GitHub's Releases page
2) Extract the contents of the `.zip` file into a new folder
3) Copy all files & folders from the extracted folder into the "**extensions**" folder found inside your Tracker folder
   - The file(s) should appear as: `[YOUR_TRACKER_FOLDER]/extensions/ImAttachedExtension.lua`

## Enable the Extension:
1) On the Tracker settings menu (click the gear icon on the Tracker window), click the "**Extensions**" button
2) In the Extensions menu, enable "**Allow custom code to run**" (if it is currently disabled)
3) Click the "**Refresh**" button at the bottom to check for newly installed extensions
   - If you don't see anything in the extensions list, double-check the extension files are installed in the right location. Refer to the Tracker wiki documentation (at the bottom) if you need additional help
4) Click on the "**I'm Attached**" extension button to view the extension
5) From here, you can turn it on or off, as well as check for updates

## Usage:
- While enabled, this extension adds a little heart icon on the main Tracker screen for your Pokémon.
- Clicking this heart icon will color it in, indicating that you're "attached" to this Pokémon. Click it again to turn it off.
- An "attached" Pokémon doesn't do anything special, but rather just a fun little indicator that you really like this Pokémon.
